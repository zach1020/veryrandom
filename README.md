# veryrandom
A quantum random number generator built with IBM's Qiskit API. Please add your own API key!

This script generates a random nuber by applying a Hadamard transform to qubits, then observing them. That's it! That's all it takes.

## Usage
- Put your API key in the code first.
- I recommend making your own Python env, activating it, then:
- `pip install qiskit` and
- `pip install ibm-qiskit-runtime`
- Finally: `python3 veryrandom.py`
